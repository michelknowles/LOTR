<h2>The People of Middle Earth</h2>
    <p>Middle Earth is a continent of a wide bredth of people. None more 
        important than the other yet all most different from the next</p>
<h3>Wizards</h3>
    <p>The Wizards, initially known as the Istari, were five Maiar spirits 
        sent to Middle-earth as human forms to aid the Free Peoples against 
        the threat of Sauron.</p>
<h3>Men</h3>
    <p>The race of Men was the second significant race of beings created 
        by the supreme God, Ilúvatar, since they awoke at the start of the 
        First Age, at the first rising of the Sun (FA 1), while the elves 
        awoke three Ages before them. They were called the "Afterborn" 
        (Quenya Atani, Sindarin: Edain) by the Elves.
        Men bear the Gift of Men, which is mortality, and therefore they 
        age and die when their time comes, and are susceptible to illness 
        and disease. Elves are immortal, in the sense that they are not 
        susceptible to aging and disease. Even if their bodies are slain, 
        their spirits will remain bound to the world for as long as it lasts, 
        and pass to the Halls of Mandos to wait until they are released or the world ends.</p>
<h3>Elves</h3>
    <p>The Elves, who called themselves the Quendi, and who in lore are 
        commonly referred to as the Eldar (adj. Eldarin), were the first 
        and eldest of the Children of Ilúvatar, and are considered to be 
        the fairest and wisest of any race of Arda given sapience.
        Some, known afterwards as the Calaquendi (Elves of the Light), 
        were brought by the Valar from Middle-earth to Valinor across the 
        Sea, where they were taught by the Ainur. But after the Silmarils 
        were stolen by Melkor, some of the Elves returned to Middle-earth, 
        where they remained until the end of the Third Age.[4]
        Elves were not subject to age, and were immune to illness. They 
        could be killed only in violence or by extreme despair.</p>
<h3>Dwarves</h3>
    <p>Dwarves were a race of Middle-earth also known as the Khazad 
        (in their own tongue), Naugrim, meaning 'Stunted People', and 
        Gonnhirrim, the 'Masters of Stone'.</p>
<h3>Hobbits</h3>
    <p>Hobbits, also known as Halflings, were an ancient mortal race 
        that lived in Middle-earth. Although their exact origins are 
        unknown, they were initially found in the northern regions of 
        Middle-earth and below the Vales of Anduin. At the beginning 
        of the Third Age, hobbits moved north and west. Most of their 
        race eventually founded the land of the Shire in about the year 
        TA 1601, though one type of hobbit known as Stoors remained in 
        the Anduin Vale (the type of hobbit Sméagol was).</p>
