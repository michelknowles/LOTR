            <p>The future of civilization rests in the fate of the One Ring, 
                which has been lost for centuries. Powerful forces are unrelenting 
                in their search for it. But fate has placed it in the hands of a 
                young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), who inherits the 
                Ring and steps into legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo 
                when he becomes the Ringbearer - to destroy the One Ring in the 
                fires of Mount Doom where it was forged.</p>
